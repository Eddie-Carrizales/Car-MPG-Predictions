# Car miles per gallon (mpg) Machine Learning Project

This project consists of two parts:

Part 1 is the manual creation of the machine learning model using the gradient descent to minimize 
the weights and predict the miles per gallon a vehicle will have depending on several attributes.

Part 2 utilizes the Scikit-learn library to create/implement the model and predict the mpg.

The purpose of this project is to analyze and determine manual vs library(automatic) implementation of ML models.
